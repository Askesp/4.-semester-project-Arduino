# 4.-semester-project-Arduino
My fourth-semester project using Arduino 

For our Fourth semester project, we were told to make a physical prototype using microcomputers such as Arduino with the theme of: "Physical design in the bathroom". From this, we wanted to develop a modernization of the shower with a focus on personalising and customising it. 

Because of the time limit for the project as well as being inexperienced with Arduino, the project had to be split into a physical prototype and a screen display prototype which was made as a website using HTML/CSS/JS. 

The "IxD_P4 (1).pdf" is a PDF-file of the entire project
The "FourthSemesterProject-ThemodernisedShower" file contains the Arduino code used for the prototype 

The abstract for the project is: 
The theme of this project was "Physical Design within the bathroom". The objective was to create a physical interactive prototype through an iterative process. The prototype for this project resulted in a customisable shower experience, that aims to make the experience of taking a shower more tailored for the individual user. The project started with a brainstorming session, followed by a Moscow model for setting prototype requirements. From the Moscow model and related work, it became clear what the necessary features were for making a tailored experience. After the Moscow model, lo-fi sketches were developed and further refined as hi-fi sketches.
The final concept was a physical prototype working through presets on a wall-mounted touchscreen, with customisable features like water pressure, temperature and height adjustment. By using these attributes, the experience can potentially achieve a more modernised shower experience.
